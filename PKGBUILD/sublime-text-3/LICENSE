Maintainer note:
Sublime Text is free to use, if you want access to the newer builds, with the package
`sublime-text-4-dev` or `sublime-text-dev`, you'll need a paid license.

Buying a license also supports the development of the editor.

---

Sublime Text may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however a license must be purchased for
continued use. Licenses are per-user, rather than per-machine, so you can enjoy Sublime Text on as
many computers and operating systems as you wish with your license.
